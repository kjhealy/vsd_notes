# This is the Course Packet

This packet contains the course material, data, and code. It’s an
RStudio project.

## What’s here

### The `vsd_course_notes.Rmd` document

An RMarkdown document to get you started on taking notes for the course.

### The `data/` folder

Datasets we will use during the course.

### The `code/` folder

Code snippets from the slides, as R script files.

### The `slides/` folder

RMarkdown files and various supporting files to generate HTML versions
of the slides. The HTML versions can be viewed in a web browser. These
RMarkdown files require supporting packages so do not expect them to
work out of the box.
