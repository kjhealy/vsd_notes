## Welcome

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a way of writing plain text that can then be converted into HTML, PDF, or MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When this document is open in RStudio and you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Setup

This section ensures some packages that you'll need are loaded.

```{r}

library(socviz)
library(gapminder)

```
